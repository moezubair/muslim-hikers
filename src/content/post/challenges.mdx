### Introduction
The club challenges are a way to encourage members to get active, be inspired and to celebrate the achievements of each other. Members who are able to complete a challenge will be recognized on the website and our social media platforms. These are meant to be challenging, and most of these will require a lot of time commitment to achieve. 


### Yearly Challenges

#### 2024 Ramadan Challenge

Ramadan is a time for reflection, prayer and to reconnect with our faith with pure intentions. This is the month we try to be the best version of ourselves, and nip any bad habits that we might have adopted over the year. Through fasting, praying, reading the Quran and giving charity, we seek to get closer to the Allah, and strengthen our spiritual connection. It's a transformative period that goes beyond the physical act of abstaining from food and drink; it's about self-discipline, empathy, and fostering a deeper understanding of the values that define us. Ramadan encourages us to cultivate patience, gratitude, and compassion, not only towards ourselves but also towards others. As an outdoors adventure group, this sacred month provides an opportunity to merge the spiritual with the physical, finding solace and inspiration in nature. Through mindful hiking, we aim to embrace the challenges of staying active during Ramadan, using the trails as a space for reflection and collective growth. 

We also need to be mindful that any activity we partake, does not hinder our ability to fast, do the obligatory prayers, and have the energy to be present in Taraweeh prayers. This challenge is not for everyone, if you feel like hiking in Ramadan will make you too tired to pray, or fast, you should abstain from it. With that being said, the 2024 Ramadan Challenge is to continue to be active in Ramadan. With shorter, quieter hikes, we hope to continue spending sometime appreciating nature and stay connected to the community. 

There are two Ramadan challenges for 2024:
  1. Participate in 4 group events during Ramadan. These can be hikes, rock climbing events, and/or community iftaar.
  2. Continue hiking on your own, or with your family/friends. Hike a total of 50km in Ramadan months, and send us the log of your activities.
