This year, we set bold goals. We moved away from Facebook to host our events on [Luma](https://lu.ma/muslim), a dedicated event management tool that makes registration smoother and more accessible. We began charging a small fee to help us build a sustainable budget, fund our operations, and plan even better trips. We also took steps behind the scenes—applying for grants, registering as a non-profit, putting efforts in our social media strategy and gaining recognition from other outdoor and community-focused organizations.

Each of these initiatives came with questions. There were moments of doubt, some resistance, and even criticism. But there was also overwhelming enthusiasm, trust, and encouragement. Your support helped us navigate these changes with intention. Because of you, we were able to host amazing trips, reach more people, and plant the seeds of something long-lasting.

We’re still just getting started. There’s so much more we want to do — trails we haven’t yet walked, communities we haven’t yet reached, and impact we haven’t yet made. And while there will always be noise and naysayers, we move forward with purpose and faith. Together, we are not only enjoying the outdoors—we are creating a legacy. From the funds we've raised together for charities, the water wells built, to personal connections made on the trails that have led to marriages and life long friendships, we have achieved so much together. I sincerely hope that despite any challenges that will come on this journey, we'll continue making a positive impact in our community.

Thank you for believing in this mission. I am grateful for all the friends who've stood by when we've faced challenges, and continue to support the mission of building a Muslim Outdoor Community. From helping with financial and logistical aspects of creating this organization, to providing moral support, and covering my shortcomings through this journey, I'm grateful for so many amazing friends and mentors I've made through this initiative. I'd like to highlight and especially thank our first 4 adventurers who signed up for Membership, to show your support! I am grateful for the leads, and volunteers who are putting in so much time and effort for the sake of building this community.

### Request

As we grow this community, we take on more risks—and place greater trust in each of you to have our backs. As participation increases, there will inevitably be individuals who try to take advantage of what we’ve built for personal gain. There may be attempts to sow division, bend rules, or exploit loopholes. In the past, I’ve relied heavily on the core community to keep an eye out for things that could lead to larger problems—to report them and help navigate them before they escalate.

However, with growth comes the challenge of scale, and it’s no longer possible for the core team to oversee everything. So I’m asking all of you—the people who joined with good intentions and who have gained something from this initiative—to treat this community with care. Let me know when you see issues that need to be addressed before they get out of hand. Make sure your own actions help foster unity, not division. Help us sustain this effort without placing too much burden on the executive team.

Many people join for a short while before life takes them elsewhere—and that’s okay. But we’re building something we hope will outlast all of us, including myself. So let’s make sure we don’t sacrifice the long-term health of this experiment for short-term gains or ego. Let’s protect this space for the people who will join in the future and for those who will keep showing up when we’re no longer able to.

We’ve got six more months left in 2025—let’s keep the momentum going and keep building, together!
