Alhumdulilah it’s been a very eventful year for the group. We grew from like 5 members to almost 2,400 this year. As we reflect upon the past year, we are filled with gratitude and awe at the incredible journey we have collectively undertaken. The trails we traversed and the bonds we forged along the way have made this year truly remarkable. All of this wouldn’t have been possible without the active participation of everyone who showed up to our events, and the organisers who volunteered their time and energy into making each event a successful one. Together, we hiked nearly 500 km this year, with our two longest hikes being ~30km and ~20km on the Bruce Trail. Here are some of the highlights of activities we did as a group this year.

## Camping Trip to Killarney

## Kids Friendly Hike at Rattlesnake

## Hikes by the water

## Special thanks

I’d like to take a moment to thank all the volunteers who’ve helped lead hikes and manage the facebook group. Alhumdulilah each hike lead volunteered their time without being asked, and took on the responsibility of researching trails, setting up the event, and leading the group on the day of the hike. 

The leads: Umer Javed, Ramsha Ahmed, Faraz, Saima Munir, Aicha Hassani, Ikram Zouari, Aliya Khatri, Ahmed Darwish, Areej Hashmi, Rebecca Zaidi, Umar Ruhi

Additionally, I’d like to thank Umer for helping with running the facebook group as a moderator. Ramsha for organising, running and managing the charity campaign for Gaza. Faraz for generating graphics to be posted on our Insta page,Tanvir and Yasseer for their videography skills
