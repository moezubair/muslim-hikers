# Vision 2025: Expanding Horizons, Local Impact

After growing from a small hiking group in 2023 to a registered non-profit with 3,500 members in 2024, we're setting our sights on ambitious new horizons for 2025. From longer guided trips, to a more focused approach of making an impact in our local community.

## Guided Trips

In 2025, we want to expand our programming from hikes to include guided camping, cabin and over night trips. We already have a sold out Brother's cabin trip, and a Sisters cabin trip planned for February. The goal of these trips are to foster deeper connections with the people we meet through this community, while experiencing the beauty of nature and making new memories. 

We're always looking for high-agency people who'd like to work with us. If you think you have what it takes to plan and run events, please reach out to us!

## New Experiences

In 2024, we had many people who got into hiking through one of our guided hikes. This year we will continue getting the community to try new experiences. We already have weekly indoor climbs where many people have tried climbing for the first time. We'll continue working towards introducing new experiences and encouraging the community to step out of their comfort zones and try something new!

## Finishing the Bruce Trail

2025 is the year we <strong>will</strong> finish the remainder of the Bruce Trail. We have about 30 km of the Beaver Valley section left and then the Sydenham and Peninsula section! 

## Local Impact
Last year we focused our fundraisers towards global causes, in particular the situation in Gaza. We raised funds for Doctors without Borders, Penny Appeal and other NGOs. This year, we want to focus on local issues and make an impact in the community we all reside in. The two areas we'll be addressing are food and housing shortages. We'll partner with foodbanks and shelters to try to make a difference in overcoming these issues.

## Education
As an outdoors group, we like to go on hikes and have fun. However, part of our mandate is learning about sustainable living, and making everyone an ambassador for environmental stewardship. In 2025, we'll be funding first aid training for our leads, sponsoring outdoor education programs for kids, and many more!
