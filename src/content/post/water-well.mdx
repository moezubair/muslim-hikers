Fall of 2023, we ran a campaign to raise funds to build a well through MuslimHands charity. We ran 5+ hikes, and raised a total of $1,200 dollars for this cause. Thanks to all the generous donors, we were able to meet this goal within the month. 


Once the funds were collected, they were directly donated to Muslim Hands so they could start utilizing them to get the project started.

### Muslim Hands Pakistan

Muslim Hands was able to find a suitable location that required a water well, and decided to pick a small village in Peshawar District of Pakistan and began its work. Here is the background they provided regarding their process of picking the location:

>In terms of reach, our team in Pakistan has been able to provide aid and relief to people across many parts of the country. Our programmes in Pakistan span over several districts including Baluchistan, Punjab, Sindh, KPK and Kashmir. Muslim Hands Pakistan has established several schools throughout the country including in Islamabad, Wazirabad, Lahore and Quetta which provide education to hundreds of orphan and needy children. Other work in the country includes feeding programmes, income generation schemes and safe water projects.
>All of this would not be possible without the intervention of our donors who have time and time again provided the essential funds required to carry out this work. Our plans and strategy for the future require more intervention, more funds and more donors playing a vital role within the development of Pakistan.

### The Project

Muslim hands provided the following details detailing the project:

>Through this programme and with the kind donation from the donor we were able to install a Dig a well which will now provide (08 H.H) with accessible safe water. The location which was selected for the project was (Village Ameer Khel Union Council Hassan Khel district Peshawar).
