As the weather gets colder, and we get snow on the trails, it's important to bring the right gear, and dress appropriately before going out on a hike.
In order to hike with the group, you are required to bring the right gear, and be dressed warm enough, or you'll be asked to turn back. This is for your safety, and the safety of the group. Note that this list is for hiking in Ontario, where we don't have to worry about avalanche and other hazards. If you are planning on hiking in the rockies, please do more research and make sure you are well prepared for the terrain.

### Clothing
In the outdoor community, there is a golden rule that Cotton kills! When selecting your winter hiking clothes, please avoid cotton. Opt for synthetic, wool, or silk fibers. This is due to the fact that cotton holds moisture and takes long to dry, which in result pulls heat from the body. 

#### Layering

When hiking in the winter, the best way to ensure you stay warm, and comfortable is to dress in layers. Typically, you need to think of three layers: a base layer, a middle layer, and a shell/outer layer.


Base layer should be the thermal layer - to keep you warm and dry. Pick either wool or synthetic material that isn't bulky. Winter leggings is a great option for tights.

Middle layer is something you can adjust based on how you feel through the hike. When you warm up, you can take the middle layer off so you don't sweat excessively. A lightweight insulated puffy jacket or a mid-weight high-loft fleece jacket is a good option. 

Similarly, for bottoms, you can get fleece pants that provide the warmth without being too bulky.

Shell/Outer layer should consist of a good quality winter jacket. For bottoms, you should get snow pants, or soft shell pants that are water resistant. 

#### Gloves, Neck gaiter, scarfs

It is essential that you not only wear proper clothes, but bring gloves and a scarf to keep your hands and ears warm during the hike! There are plenty of gloves in the market, but make sure you get winter gloves that will keep your hands warm.

Additionally, bringing a neck gaiter is a great idea to ensure you can keep your neck warm, and if required pull it up to cover part of your face. A scarf also helps in keeping your ears and neck covered.


### Gear

#### Microspikes / Crampons

The most important safety gear for hiking in the winter is Microspikes. These can go over your hiking shoes and provide traction when there is ice on the trail. 99% of the hikes we'll do in the winter will **require** that you bring Microspikes.

You can get these from any of the outdoor stores like Mec, Canadian Tires, or directly from Amazon.

These are also called crampons. When buying crampons/microspikes, you need to make sure you get the right size. Although they can usually accomodate a range of sizes, if you are buying it for your kids, you will need to buy the smallest size available. 


#### Gaiters

Often when you're out on the trail in snow, there will be sections that have deep snow. To ensure you don't get snow inside your shoes, you can buy gaiters. These go over your pants, and connect under your shoes, ensuring no mud, or snow get's in your shoes. These are optional, but highly recommended.

We recommend these from Amazon: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.ca/Azarxis-Backpacking-Breathable-Lightweight-Waterproof/dp/B074TCP8Q9/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=gators&amp;sr=8-7&amp;th=1&_encoding=UTF8&tag=redfactor-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=991017256c98acfb3a6ddfbf3aea6743&camp=15121&creative=330641">Azarxis Hiking Gaiters</a>

#### Winter boots
Hiking in your running shoes on winter conditions is not a good idea! Please invest in good winter boots that will keep your feet warm. Getting shoes that cover your ankle help provide stability and support to your ankles during the hike.

#### Hiking poles
Hiking poles can be a great help while traversing trails during the winter. They provide additional support while descending and ascending steeper sections of the trail. 

#### Flashlight
It is always a good idea to carry flashlight in your bag during the winter hikes. It gets darker way earlier, and having a source of light can come in handy!
