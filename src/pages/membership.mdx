Muslim Outdoor Adventures (MOA) is a registered non-profit organization. While we are not profit-driven, we do have operational costs and a vision for growth. To help sustain and expand our programs, we ask attendees to contribute a modest fee of **$2–$5 per event**.

If you are unable to pay, you are still welcome. Please email **social@muslimoutdooradventures.com** with the event link, and we’ll manually register you—no questions asked. We kindly ask that you only use this option if you truly cannot afford the fee.

## Why We’ve Introduced This Fee

- **Sustainable Growth**: We began as a hobby group, but growing interest led us to incorporate officially. This allows us to scale responsibly without relying on one person to manage everything.
- **Rising Operational Costs**: Though incorporation was inexpensive, the ongoing costs (permitting, supplies, tech, etc.) are growing.
- **Volunteer Support**: Our volunteers dedicate significant time and energy. Modest contributions help us acknowledge their efforts meaningfully.
- **Community Accountability**: A nominal fee encourages genuine participation and discourages misuse of the group’s mission and resources.

## Safety and Training

We aim to have all our hike leads certified in first aid and plan to register MOA as an official outdoor organization with event insurance. These steps are critical for participant safety and sustainable growth—and require funding. We're working to raise these funds thoughtfully without putting undue strain on our members.

## Our Vision

We have big dreams for MOA: scholarships to help young Muslims connect with the outdoors, hands-on workshops, and one day establishing our own outdoor facility. Building a financial foundation now is key to making these goals a reality.

## How We Compare

Similar outdoor groups in the GTA charge **$10–$20+ per event**, while internationally, comparable day trips often range from **$30–50**.

## Our Commitment

We're committed to keeping events accessible and affordable. While exploring grants and external funding, your contributions—no matter the size—help build a stronger, more vibrant MOA community.

# Membership

To make things easier, you can choose to become a MOA member instead of paying per event. We offer two flexible options:

- **Monthly Membership**: Pay $8 monthly, charged from the day you sign up.
- **Annual Membership**: Pay $80 once a year at a discounted rate.

Membership grants you access to all regular events without additional per-event payments.

For newcomers: we host events almost every weekend, from challenging hikes on the Bruce Trail to casual walks near the GTA. We also organize outdoor social events—and we have even bigger plans for this year!

Finally, we want to sincerely thank all the hike leads and volunteers who have supported MOA over the past few years. Your dedication has helped us reach this exciting new chapter. We couldn't have done it without you.
