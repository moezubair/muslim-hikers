  Muslim Outdoor Adventures is dedicated to fostering a deep connection with nature, building confidence, and nurturing a strong sense of community through outdoor exploration. We are committed to creating a welcoming and safe environment for individuals and families of diverse backgrounds to appreciate the wonders of the outdoors. Our mission revolves around breaking down barriers and promoting diversity, inclusivity, and accessibility, while upholding the values of faith, kindness, and resilience. Through a range of activities and events, we strive to provide opportunities for individuals to get involved in outdoor activities, develop new skills, and embrace the transformative influence of nature.

## Philosophy 

The Muslim Outdoor Adventures is a non-profit, volunteer run club that believes in responsible use of outdoor spaces. As Muslims we hold deep awe and respect for nature, and promote responsible use of land. We advocate for conservative use of natural resources, protection of environment and principles of sustainability. We believe Muslims are under-represented in the outdoors community, due to lack of opportunities and awareness. Through our educational, outreach and guided programs we aim to get more Canadian Muslims involved in outdoor spaces and become leaders in sustainable and responsible use of the land. 

## Our Objectives
* To create and foster a community of Outdoorsy Muslims in Ontario, Canada
* To educate the community in sustainable and responsible use of natural spaces
* To inspire, motivate and facilitate outdoor expeditions 
* To provide safe, inclusive and educational experiences in the outdoors
