### Overview
As a Hike Lead, you play a crucial role in creating, organizing, and guiding hiking excursions for our outdoor enthusiasts. Your responsibilities encompass the entire hiking experience: from detailed trip planning to managing the experience during the hike. You strive to ensure a fulfilling, safe, and memorable time on trail for all participants.

### Responsibilities Before the Hike
#### Designing Your Trip
Research, explore, and analyze your trip in advance of publishing your event. Use the following guidelines and questions while envisioning your trip:
1. What type of terrain are you comfortable leading hiking trips on?
1. What type of weather are you comfortable hiking in?
1. What is the desired duration you would like to be in the outdoors?
1. What hiking pace can you comfortably lead a group in?
1. Determine your trip:
    * Based on your desired duration and pace, what distance can you reasonably hike?
    * Alternatively, if you have a desired route or distance and you know your pace, how long is your trip expected to take?
1. What group size are you comfortable managing on your own? This includes keeping track of participants and moderating your pace to ensure the group sticks together.
1. What minimum experience level would you need your participants to have?
1. Would you need additional volunteer hike leaders to assist you?

The points above should help you get a better understanding of the trip parameters that will dictate the location, timing, and route details for your trip.

        <td>“Measure twice, hike once”<br />
        Planning a route begins with picking an area to hike in and should detail everything from the moment hikers arrive in a vehicle and where they park, to the moment they return safely to their vehicle after the hike ends.</td>
        <td>“There is no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothing”<br />
            Weather is still a key factor in determining the safety and fulfilment of a hike. Consider weather forecasts to understand the difficulty in accessing and participating in the hike, and also impact on experience.</td>
        <td>“Hope for the best but plan for the worst” <br />
            Risk management is a practice of assessing and planning solutions in advance to objective and subjective hazards on the trail.<br />
            <strong>Objective</strong> hazards are risk factors inherent to the trail environment, e.g. cliffs, fall-hazards, poison-ivy, wildlife, etc.<br />
            <strong>Subjective</strong> hazards are risk factors that are human-caused, e.g. overexertion, improper preparation for the environment, inadequate navigation aids, etc</td>

            3. What is the terrain like (flat, rolling, rough, icy), and do attendees need any specific footwear or skill-level?<br />
            4. Where is parking and the trailhead?<br />
            5. Is the trail accessible when you plan to hike? Are there any daily or seasonal trail closures?</td>
        <td>1. What is the expected temperature range in your area?<br />
         2. What is the probability of precipitation and how will that impact route conditions (mud or ice)?<br />
         3. How will weather impact clothing and footwear choices?Will weather impact the start or end times for the hike?</td>
        <td>Will you have a means to call 911?<br />
        Do you or another attendee have certification, training, or awareness of general first-aid?<br />
Do you have a turnaround time, that you must turn back to your cars to avoid being caught in the dark or in inclement weather?<br />
Have you submitted a trip itinerary on the event page?<br />
Have you assessed the general skill level and preparedness of attendees at the start of the event?<br />
Do other attendees know how to navigate in your absence?<br />
Are people made aware of objective hazards on the trail and know how to avoid them?</td>
