### Step 7: Approval and Transfer

One of the calendar managers will approve your event if you followed all the steps and are registered to create events. 

They'll also make the following changes
* Move from Personal Calendar to MOA Calendar
* Set optional donation for ticket (if there is no charge by venue). This helps us to sustain the costs of running MOA
* Make a post on Whatsapp and Insta
