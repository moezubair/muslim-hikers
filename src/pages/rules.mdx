Muslim Outdoor Adventures (MOA) is a volunteer-led group that organizes various events to promote outdoors exploration. By participating in any MOA activities, you automatically agree to follow our rules. These rules are current as of January 1st 2024 and are subject to change at any time with or without notice.

#### Waiver
You must sign the waiver at https://www.MuslimOutdoorAdventures.com/waiver before attending *any* of our events! Trip leads can refuse your participation if you haven't signed the waiver.

#### PHOTOGRAPHY
All Participants are encouraged to document the Event; however we stress you take extra measures to protect your equipment from undergoing damage. Also note that, during the Event, Club Representatives may be taking photos for use on the web site, in newsletters or other promotional materials. By participating in a Club Event, you are granting the Club permission to reuse these photos of you in such a manner.

#### First Aid
Event Attendees are responsible for their own First Aid care and are encouraged to carry a First Aid kit, and have first aid training.

Treat wildlife with respect. Always observe from a safe distance. We do not encourage or condone approaching wild animals or attempting to feed them.
